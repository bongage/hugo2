# Welcome to My Website

This is a sample home page.

I expect my **recent posts** to show up in here. Maybe they won't, though. 

## Roadmap

### First things to do

We try to get a couple of posts going on this page.
Then we'll try to create a menu.
Maybe even get thumbnails for our post snippets, too.

### The major plan

After that, we can look into using bootstrap on the post grid.

I'm mainly curious on whether we can easily get the nice articles layout or not.

Also, we need to know if we can apply code from codepen and how.

### Before learning to publish to github pages

Lastly, I need to know more about markdown, what it can do and can't.

*That's our roadmap for now
